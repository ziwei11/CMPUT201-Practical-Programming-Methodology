  CMPUT201W20 Midterm 3 Question 3
  
  This program attempts to create a growing list of coolbears.
  Coolbears have names, metadata (junk), and temperatures. We want to
  add test bears and iterate through them and calculate their average
  temperature. But something is wrong and the program doesn't work.
  I changed only 2 lines.

  In this comment please describe how you fixed this problem and what
  tools you used:
  Line 107, we cannot use int16_t because the range of int 16 is [âˆ’32768, +32767].
  However, NBEARS = 33000 which is bigger than 32767.
  Thus, we cannot use int_16 here,
  but we can use int here because the range of int is [-2147483648, 2147483647].
 
  Line 128, we cannot use size_t because the range of size_t is [0, 4294967295].
  i will become -1 after the for loop, overflow.
  Thus, we cannot use size_t here,
  but we can use int here because the range of int is [-2147483648, 2147483647].
